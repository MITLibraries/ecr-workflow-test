# ecr_test

Just for testing the ECR shared workflows. This app doesn't need to do anything other than build via Docker.

## Development

- To preview a list of available Makefile commands: `make help`
- To install with dev dependencies: `make install`
- To update dependencies: `make update`
- To run unit tests: `make test`
- To lint the repo: `make lint`
- To run the app: `uv run my-app --help` (Note the hyphen `-` vs underscore `_` that matches the `project.scripts` in `pyproject.toml`)

## Environment Variables
